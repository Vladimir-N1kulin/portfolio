# Portfolio Website

This is a responsive portfolio website that dynamically showcases my recent GitHub projects. The site fetches project data using the GitHub API and displays each project in a visually appealing card layout.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content:** Automatically lists my most recently updated repositories (excluding forks).
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap, ensuring a sleek layout on all devices.
- **Custom Styling:** Unique project cards with default images, fixed heights, and truncation of long descriptions. A "Read More" link is provided to visit each repository on GitHub.
- **Modern UI Elements:** Includes sections for a detailed about me, certifications, and a contact button for easier collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the website.
- **JavaScript:** Fetches and processes data from the GitHub API.
- **Bootstrap 4:** Provides responsive grid and style components.
- **Additional Libraries:** jQuery, Magnific Popup, Owl Carousel, and more.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Open the project folder** in your preferred IDE.
3. **Customize the content** (change GitHub username, update project details, etc.) in the `index.html` and `style.css` files as needed.
4. **Run the project** on your local server or deploy it to your preferred hosting platform.

## Customization

- **GitHub Projects:** The script in `index.html` fetches your public repositories. Adjust the `maxProjects` variable to change the number of projects displayed.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS in `style.css` controls card dimensions, text truncation, and overall responsiveness.
